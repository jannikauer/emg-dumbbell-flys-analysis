# emg-dumbbell-flys-analysis
As part of a biosignal-processing course I measured the muscular activity of the chest and shoulder muscle for three different arm positions during a dumbbell chest fly.
This code processes the data and creates plots that show the results:

The plot below implies that the relative muscle activity as a percentage of the MVC value is highest during the 45Â° arm position with similar results for both chest and shoulder muscles:
